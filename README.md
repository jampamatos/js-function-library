# js-function-library
## My own JavaScript function library.

In this repo, I plan to add all JS scripts that I learn and find interesting, with a brief explanation on how they work (just in case I forget).

1. **input.num.manipulation - ** An HTML file that contains an input, in which the user enters a number, and the page outputs that number squared, cubed and factored. The script listens to the input change, does the calculations and then puts it back to the page in a <p> element.
1. **username-validation - ** My very first Codeland challenge, a simple script that takes a string (that could come from an user input for example) and checks if it's between 4 and 25 characters long, if it contains only numbers, letters and underscore, if it starts with a letter and if it does not end with an underscore.
